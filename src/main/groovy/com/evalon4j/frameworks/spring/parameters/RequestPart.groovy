/**
 * Annotation that can be used to associate the part of a "multipart/form-data" request
 * with a method argument.
 *
 * <p>Supported method argument types include {@link MultipartFile} in conjunction with
 * Spring's {@link MultipartResolver} abstraction, {@code javax.servlet.http.Part} in
 * conjunction with Servlet 3.0 multipart requests, or otherwise for any other method
 * argument, the content of the part is passed through an {@link HttpMessageConverter}
 * taking into consideration the 'Content-Type' header of the request part. This is
 * analogous to what @{@link RequestBody} does to resolve an argument based on the
 * content of a non-multipart regular request.
 *
 * <p>Note that @{@link RequestParam} annotation can also be used to associate the part
 * of a "multipart/form-data" request with a method argument supporting the same method
 * argument types. The main difference is that when the method argument is not a String
 * or raw {@code MultipartFile} / {@code Part}, {@code @RequestParam} relies on type
 * conversion via a registered {@link Converter} or {@link java.beans.PropertyEditor} while
 * {@link RequestPart} relies on {@link HttpMessageConverter HttpMessageConverters}
 * taking into consideration the 'Content-Type' header of the request part.
 * {@link RequestParam} is likely to be used with name-value form fields while
 * {@link RequestPart} is likely to be used with parts containing more complex content
 * e.g. JSON, XML).
